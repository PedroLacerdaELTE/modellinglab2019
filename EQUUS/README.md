In recent years electronic transport propoerties of aa variety of low dimensional electron systems, such as carbon based novel materials like carbon nanotubes or graphene, boron nitride, dichalcogenides, a selection of intriguing molecules and the surface states of topological insulators has captured the imagination of the solid-state community. These systems have several interesting properties that make them not only interesting for theoretical investigations but could also lead to revolutionary applications from wearable electronics to quantum computers. To take control of these peculiar features a comprehensive and detailed theoretical study is needed. Equus offers a solution to treat these challenges in a unified manner.


## The package

[EQUUS](http://eqt.elte.hu/EQuUs/html/)  is a matlab/octave package for performing transport calculations on mesoscopic systems.

## The task is to:

1. Install the Equus package.
2. Run the example for calculation of the minimal conductivity of graphene. Using this example understand how a system is defined and how transmission coefficients and hence conductivity is calculated based on the definition. 
3. Calculate transport through a mesoscopic constriction in a constant magnetic field.

4. Choose one or more further tasks from [this](http://oroszl.web.elte.hu/mezo/Tasks.html) list and solve it with Equus.
5. Find the signatures of [Majorana fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion) in by reproducing the [Delft experiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26142) numerically!
