# Hydrodynamics

Here you can experiment with one of the mostly used Computational Fluid Dynamics softwares.
The [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com/) package is able to simulate and solve several problems in
Turbulence and in Problems with thermal energy and compressible fluids.

## Steps

1. Download and install the package

2. Read the [tutorial](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/tutorials/#x4-30002) and reproduce some basic results

3. Read the general guide on possible [applications](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/applications/) and select at least two of them
for replication.

4. Select a research project from the last 5 years in the topic covered by the simulator, and reproduce the results.
A good starting point is a [scientific overview](http://powerlab.fsb.hr/ped/kturbo/openfoam/papers/CMND2007.pdf) of the OpenFOAM package.
Refer to citation archives and find manuscripts that cite this package.
