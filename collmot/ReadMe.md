# Collective motion

Study collective motion

## Steps
1. Install the simulation program and dependencies. Familiarize yourself with the basic parameters.
2. Generate a number of flock using different parameters. Visualize your results
3. Find differences in similarities from the generated trajectories
4. Calculate metrics of thermalling success
5. Explore the parameter space for a certain air velocity field
6. Do the same for different air flows. How do they perform?
7. Are some strategies better suit for certain air flows?
