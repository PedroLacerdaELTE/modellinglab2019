# Collective motion

Study collective motion
![Thermalling Example](thermal_example.png)

## Introduction
In this project you will experiment with a simulation framework with the goal of generating flocks of soaring birds (such as storks or vultures) while flying in a atmospheric convective updraft (thermal).

There are two major goals on this project. The first is to explore the possible outputs this framework offers and display them in a precise and scientifically meaningful way. The second goal is to characterize the individual trajectories and airflows, and how they connect to each other.

Important note: It would be prefered if you used Linux. Although the software should run in any platform, the installation process is much, much easier on Linux.

## Steps
1. Install the simulation program and dependencies. Familiarize yourself with the basic parameters.
2. Generate a number of flock using different parameters. Visualize your results
3. Find differences and similarities from the generated trajectories
4. Calculate metrics of thermalling success
5. Explore the parameter space for a certain air velocity field
6. Do the same for different air flows. How do they perform?
7. Are some strategies better suit for certain air flows?
