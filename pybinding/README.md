# Pybinding

[Pybinding](http://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/) is a python package for tight-binding calculations. 
With the help of this package one can easily create simple tight-binding models describing noninteracting
electron systems, and calculate various physical properties, like density of states and electrical conductivity.
The aim of the project is to install the package and with the help of it first investigate certain properties
of simple systems, finally to reproduce some published results.
